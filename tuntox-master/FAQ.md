## How to report crash issues?

* [Learn to use GDB](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Backtrace#Generation) (or see [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Debug_-_Getting_Traces#Getting_the_trace) if you can't stand seeing the Ubuntu logo)
* Preferably, [build tuntox and c-toxcore from source](BUILD.md)
* run tuntox with `-d -d -d` switch (yes, three times) on both sides (client and server)
* Try reproducing the problem
* Type `backtrace full` in gdb console when it crashes
* Paste full debug output including gdb output in your issue. Don't forget to paste log from the other side (eg. from a client when you're reporting a server crash).
* Describe exactly how you reproduced the problem. Preferably try reproducing it again.

## How to report non-crash issues?

* Make sure you're running the latest version
* run tuntox with `-d -d -d` switch (yes, three times):

```
tuntox -d -d -d -i ABDE4CF4541C27DBE36A812FF6752F71A9F44D1CF917CE489B30CC3D742500039B86C14F85F9
```

* Try reproducing the problem and note approximate date/time of the problem, so that logs can be cross-referenced
* Depending on the nature of the problem, logs from both server and client may be needed
* Describe exactly how you reproduced the problem. Preferably try reproducing it again.

## Why is my connection slow?

The actual p2p connection is made by the [c-toxcore](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore) library. The way it works is: it tries to establish a direct connection between peers and falls back to [TCP relays](https://nodes.tox.chat/) if that's impossible.

The direct connection code doesn't see much work and c-toxcore sometimes uses a TCP relay even when both peers have a public IP address and can reach each other directly. 

Also please note that sometimes the connection improves after a few minutes as the peers discover each other.

You're going to get the best connection if you see the following message on the client:

```
2018-03-24 08:59:21: [INFO]     Friend request accepted (An UDP connection has been established)!
```

The connection is likely to have worse latency when you see the following:

```
2018-03-24 08:57:21: [INFO]     Friend request accepted (A TCP connection has been established (via TCP relay))!
```

There's, however, a chance that it will upgrade to UDP after a few minutes:

```
2018-03-24 10:17:06: [INFO]     Friend connection status changed to: An UDP connection has been established
```

## I have a direct UDP connection. Why isn't my connection faster?

Wait until https://github.com/gjedeer/tuntox/issues/41 is implemented. This change should improve speed and latency in the 10 Mbit/s+ range.

You're a joke for not using NoScript.
